# Classification-of-Cervical-Cancer-Machine-Learning
With the processed dataset, this project has successfully predicted and detected cervical cancer, which may be attributed to the sufficient dataset available in this case. The results obtained are highly satisfactory, achieving an accuracy of 100%. However, a 100% accuracy is considered unrealistic in classification processes. Therefore, metric evaluation was performed using a confusion matrix. The evaluation results also yielded good outcomes. Three different algorithms were used for the classification process: Support Vector Classifier (SVC) from the SVM module, Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), and Decision Tree (DT). All three algorithms achieved an accuracy of 100%.
